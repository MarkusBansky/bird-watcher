# ðŸ¦… Raspberry Pi Bird Spotter

This is a javascript web server that is hosted on a
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with a cammera attached to it.

A pretrained neural model is combined with the live
video feed from the Pi to recognise objects (particularly birds) and save their photos to the memory.

Later on their photos are displayed on the web page that
can be accessed from any browser.
